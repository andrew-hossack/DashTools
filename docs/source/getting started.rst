Installation instructions and basic usage.

- **OS** - Linux, MacOS, Windows
- **Python Version** â‰¥ 3.6

- **[OPTIONAL] Heroku CLI** - `Download Here <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli>`_

PyPI
-------

You can install dash-tools from PyPI via pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dash-tools


Simple Usage
----------
Using dash-tools is similar to other popular command line clients for creating and deploying projects.

.. note::
    Some Windows users may need to run dashtools with ``.\dashtools`` in the following examples.

|
Creating a Project
**********************

Creating a new dash project is simple. Here we choose to name it "MyApp". Doing so will create a directory named "MyApp" in the current working directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    dashtools init MyApp

|
Deploying a Project
**********************

You can deploy any project containing a src/app.py file that is published to a GitHub Public repository. Run the DashTools Render GUI for a seamless experience.


You can deploy your application to Render.com with the easy to use UI. You can deploy any project containing a src/app.py file! Running the following command will start the dashtools gui at http://127.0.0.1:8050/

.. code-block:: bash
    
    dashtools gui

Running the following command will create Procfile, requirements.txt, and runtime.txt if they are not found. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the deployment to Heroku.

.. note::
    Heroku has stopped supporting free-tier hosting on their platform. Check out Render.com for a great alternative!

.. code-block:: bash
    
    dashtools heroku --deploy

|
Updating a Deployed Project on Heroku
************************************

Updating a deployed project is as easy as pushing changes to the remote Heroku repository. Using the following command from the project root will update the remote 'heroku' repository and restart the application.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    dashtools heroku --update

|
Running a Project
**********************

Running the app.py file is as simple as running the following command from the project root, or any directory above the app.py file.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    dashtools run

|
Dockerizing a Project
**********************

To create a Docker image for your project, run the following command in the project root with an image name.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    dashtools docker --init MyProjectImage
